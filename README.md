# Horse Racing

The player starts with a certain amount of money and then gets to bet on horse races.
Before a race, the stats and probability of each horse is shown to let the player bet a certain amount on that race. 
At the end of the race, either add the money or notify the player of their loss. 
The plater could win/lose when they have a certain amount of money
The game should probably have slightly better odds than what they would be in real life to allow the player to do well. 
For added complexity, a GUI could be created or even a live view of the horses as they race.
